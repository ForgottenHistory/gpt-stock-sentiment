# gpt-stock-sentiment

 GPT application to read news headlines about stocks. It functions using [AlphaVantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co) and OpenAI ChatGPT.

 __main__.py needs to be run at 5:30 AM, 6:00 AM then every hour to 4PM.

This is inspired by a study about using ChatGPT-4 and other LLMs to potentially aid in financial trading, especially sentiments about stocks.

My method differs as it consider news cummaltive instead of seperate. Potentially I will try the study's method if this does not work as planned.
